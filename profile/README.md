Welcome to Mugen-Builders; we are the Developer Advocates at Cartesi dedicated to empowering developers in their web3 building journey. We are a group of enthusiastic mentors, educators, and innovators committed to teaching, mentoring, and onboarding developers into the dynamic world of web3.

Cartesi is a modular blockchain protocol that provides developers with access to a full Linux environment through its native virtual machine, combined with high-performance rollups designed to support the creation of next-generation dApps. Cartesi Rollups is layer-2 solution for scalable smart contracts, offering a blend of on-chain and off-chain computation. It opens up new possibilities for developing decentralized applications with real-world computations without compromising decentralization.
